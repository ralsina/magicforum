==========

This is a forum. It runs on JS and some API calls. Just put the forum.html file somewhere and use it
and you have my forum.

To have your own forum, make a copy, create yourself a [Firebase](http://firebase.com) database,
a [Disqus](http://disqus.com) forum, replace mine with yours, and put it somewhere.

For bonus cool points, drop the file into [dataurl](http://dataurl.net/#dataurlmaker) and you will
get a huge URL which you can then pass to [tinyurl](http://tinyurl.com) and end up with a forum
that has no hosting (at least none you pay for).

The only problem with that approach is that comment counts on threads will not work.
